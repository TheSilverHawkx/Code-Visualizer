# Code Visualizer

## Introduction
Welcome to the Code Visualizer, an innovative tool designed to transform Node.js codebases into visual flowcharts. This project is currently under active development and aims to help developers understand complex codebases by visualizing both structural and functional aspects of the software.

## Purpose
The Code Visualizer seeks to address several challenges faced by developers today:
- **Complexity in Understanding Large Codebases**: As projects grow, understanding the intricate details and dependencies can become daunting. Visualizing these elements makes navigation and comprehension easier.
- **Debugging and Code Review**: Visual flowcharts can simplify the process of identifying bugs and understanding the flow of execution, which is especially useful during code reviews.
- **Onboarding Developers**: New developers can quickly understand project architecture through visual maps, accelerating the onboarding process.

## Project Status
This project is currently a work in progress. We are in the early stages of development, focusing on setting up the foundational CLI tool, creating a crawler to identify and catalog JavaScript and TypeScript files, and developing a basic dependency mapper. Future phases will introduce more sophisticated code parsing, advanced visualization features, and interactive elements.
